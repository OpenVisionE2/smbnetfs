SMBNetFS is a Linux/FreeBSD filesystem that allow you to use samba/microsoft
network in the same manner as the network neighborhood in Microsoft Windows.

Features:
 - Linux-2.6 and FreeBSD >= 6.0 are supported (Linux-2.4 is not tested)
 - you can use Samba/Microsoft network as a regular unix filesystem
 - workgroup/computer/share entries are dynamically created
 - windows domain supported
 - user defined workgroup/link/hosts are supported
 - national character supported
 - in config files you can specify different user/password to access different
   network shares
 - use gnome keyring as password storage
 - you can access any computer in the world by "cd mountpoint/ip-addr"
   command, where "ip-addr" is the IP address of the desired computer. Do not
   warry that there is no file with such name :-)
 - command "cd mountpoint/username:password@computer_or_ip" allows you to
   access "computer_or_ip" as user "username" with password "password"
   (this is insecure, but usefull) 
 - the program is multithreaded, so simultaneous access to a file/share
   is possible
 - config files are reloaded every 5 min or by SIGHUP signal
 - sources
